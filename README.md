# Crystal Editor

NOT open source, but i plan on figuring out lisencing stuff later.

PLEASE do NOT use this (yet) to make editors for games!!!
Any editors made will not be forward compatable with features i plan to add. 
Fixing forward compatability is currently my #1 priority, as soon as i'm confidant the program is forward compatabile i'll make a release.

If you want to help my discord is dawnbomb.
