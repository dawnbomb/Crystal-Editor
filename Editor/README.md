# Crystal Editor

NOT open source, but i plan on figuring out lisencing stuff later.

PLEASE do NOT use this (yet) to make editors for games!!!
Any editors made will not be forward compatable with features i plan to add. 
Fixing forward compatability is currently my #1 priority, as soon as i'm confidant the program is forward compatabile i'll make a release.

If you want to help my discord is dawnbomb.

Read about the project in much more detail over here: <https://www.crystalmods.com/index.php/crystal-editor/>

NuGet Packages used: 
Ookii.Dialogs.Wpf by OOkii Dialogs Contributors  (used for selecting files, appearently WPF has literally no way to do this by defalt, yes really)
System.Text.Encoding.CodePages by Microsoft  (used to encode / decode text from hex to english/japanese and back)

Project is C# / WPF / .net7 / Visual Studio 2022
